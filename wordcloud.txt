In this article, we are going to see how to build a word cloud with R. Word cloud is a text mining technique that allows us to highlight the most frequently used keywords in paragraphs of text. This technique is sometimes referred to as text clouds or tag clouds, which is a visual representation of text data.The second step is to transform these text files into a R – readable format. The package TM and other text mining packages operate on a format called corpus. Corpus is just a way to store a collection of documents in a R software readable format.Text mining deals with relationships between words and analyzing the sentiment made by the combination of these words and their relationship. Structured data have defined number of variables and all the analysis is done by finding out correlation between these variables. But in text mining the relationship is found between all the words present in the text.  This is the reason text mining is rarely used in the industry today. But R offers such tools which make this analysis much simpler. This article covers only the tip of the iceberg. In one of the coming articles, we will cover a framework of analyzing unstructured data.
